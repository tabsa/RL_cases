# Cases on Reinforcement learning
Examples and cases that I solved when exploring Reinforcement Learning (RL) to energy-related problems. Enjoy!

##  Background
Material used during this project:
- Slides and videos from David Silver course on RL, available [here](https://www.davidsilver.uk/teaching/);
- Update with further open-source material!

## Basic examples
- OpenAI gym [here](OpenAI_gym)
